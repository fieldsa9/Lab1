        </p>
    
        <p>
            Favorite Movie/TV Show: My favorite movie, just like my favorite book is Jurassic Park. My favorite TV show is Doctor Who. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Favorite Food: My favorite food is sandwiches. There are so many different types and ways to make a sandwich that you could eat them everyday and not eat the same one twice. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Favorite Music/Musician: I really love just about all kinds of music, but I really love, punk pop, reggae, and rock music. The only music that I really dont care for is Country music because I feel it all sounds the same.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Favorite Color: My favorite color is green. Green is the color of life and nature. I love the spring and summer time because everything turns green again! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My solution to feel better when I get down: When I'm feeling down I like to curl up on the couch and either watch Netflix or play a really good videogame. Maybe I will eat a food that I really like or even just take a nap!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What makes me happy: What makes me the most happy is spending time with my family. I usually feel the most happy when my family all gets together and has a big party. The combination of good food and even better people is always a recipe for happiness!
